The full code and the original CSV file link are included in the final_report.ipynb file. However, each code chunk also exists seperately.

This project was originally developed in collaboration with classmates at American University of Armenia. Elene Hovsepyan, Tigran Atayan, Nane Sarukhanyan.

This project analyzes ~ 1 million rows of movie and TV show data from the TMDB dataset to explore trends in ratings, popularity, genres, and production details. The goal is to extract meaningful insights using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations. 

Input/Output:
Each script functions as a standalone I/O engine. The input is a user-provided movie title or genre. Depending on the engine, the output includes confirmation of a film’s existence, IMDB/TMDB identifiers, language information, runtime and genre details, related movies by genre, or direct links to the film’s online pages. All outputs are generated dynamically based on user input rather than preloaded data.
